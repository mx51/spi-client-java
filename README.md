# SPI Client Java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mx51/spi-client-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mx51/spi-client-java)

This is the Java Client Library for mx51's In-Store Integration.

# Usage

The sections below explain how to use this library in your project, depending on what build tool you use.

Library version is henceforth referred to as 'X.Y.Z', to find out what release versions are available, check the [tags](https://github.com/mx51/spi-client-java/releases).

## Maven/Gradle

Easiest way to import the library into your project is using the Maven repository:

1. Add JCenter repository 
    - URL: https://jcenter.bintray.com/
2. Import dependency into your project: 
    - GroupId: `io.mx51`
    - ArtifactId: `spi-client-java`
    - Version: `X.Y.Z`
    
See specific examples for build tools below.

### Gradle example

Declare the repository:

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
```

And use the library as a dependency:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'io.mx51:spi-client-java:X.Y.Z'
}
```

### Maven example

Configure the repository to be used for dependency resolution:

```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jcenter</id>
        <url>https://jcenter.bintray.com/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

And use the library as a dependency:

```
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.mx51</groupId>
        <artifactId>spi-client-java</artifactId>
        <version>X.Y.Z</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Ant and others

For builds that cannot use the Maven repository, you can download a ZIP distribution from the [downloads](https://github.com/mx51/spi-client-java/releases) section, look for a file `spi-client-java-X.Y.Z.zip` with the latest version.

Alternatively, you can generate such a ZIP distribution manually by running the following:

```
./gradlew client:distZip
```

The output can be found in `./client/build/distributions` after the command completes.
